# Plotly email template demo

A repo for code reproducing an HTML email mockup for Plotly.

## Notes

Assets were exported from the Figma mockup where possible (the Plotly logo would not export as a single merged file so I used the brand logo from plotly.com). As such the logo is slightly pixelated - and for time I exported the social icons as a single image.  

In the final section, the side-by-side 50% columns are not exactly sized like the 60%-40% of the mockup. The second row of these 50-50 cols also stacks text-first, instead of duplicating the image-text order of the first row. With more time I would reverse this to be consistent, as well as tweak the spacing/padding/height between all columns on mobile. I chose to focus on reproducing the general layout, making it responsive, adding a dark version, and doing a minimum QA pass to address email client variability.

Images are hosted on gh-pages and are accessible for email clients.

Dark mode version is accessible via dark mode link in the footer.

Parcel bundler was used for development.

Email was tested in gmail, hotmail, outlook clients.
