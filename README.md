# Plotly email template demo

A repo for code reproducing an HTML email mockup for Plotly.

## Notes

All assets were exported from Figma mockup where possible (the Plotly logo would not export as a single merged file so I used the brand logo from plotly.com). As such the logo is slightly pixelated.

For time I exported the social icons as a single image.  

In the final section, the side-by-side 50% columns are not exactly sized like the 60%-40% of the mockup. Not being an HTML email developer, I focused on reproducing the bulk of the layout and making it responsive.

Images are hosted on gh-pages and are accessible for email clients.
